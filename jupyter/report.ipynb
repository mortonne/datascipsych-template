You may add your two functions to the `project.task` module, and/or create a new module and add functions there. You must also add a heading in the README.md file called `Installation`, which explains to a user how they can install your project once they have downloaded your project directory, and how they can run your notebook. You can assume that the user is experienced with using Visual Studio Code. You must make sure that any necessary dependencies are indicated in your `pyproject.toml` file so that they are automatically installed when the user installs your project using Pip."

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In free-recall studies, participants study a list of words and then attempt to recall them in any order they want, with the goal of recalling as many items as possible. Researchers have found that evidence of *serial position effects*, where the probability of recalling a given item varies depending on what position it was studied in the list. Words tend to be easier to recall if they were presented toward the start of the list; this is called the *primacy effect*. Words also tend to be easier to recall if they were presented toward the end of the list; this is called the *recency effect*. The recency can be observed when people recall events from their life; more recent events tend to be easier to recall, all else being equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polyn, Erlikhman, & Kahana (2011) wanted to know how the content of the words in the list affects serial position effects. They had participants complete three kinds of recall tests. In the *uncategorized* condition, participants studied lists of 24 words each, where each word was taken from a different category. After studying each list, participants were asked to complete a *free recall* test where they verbally recalled as many words as they could from the list, in whatever order they wanted. In the *categorized* condition, participants studied lists of words drawn from three categories that were mixed together in the list, with 8 words from each category. After studying each lists, participants completed a free recall test. In the recall-by-category condition, participants studies lists drawn from three categories, like in the categorized lists. However, at the end of the list, they completed a modified free recall task, where they were asked about each category in turn. They were first asked to recall words from one category, then a second category, and finally a third category.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors wanted to determine how recall varies based on serial position and task condition. The main question was whether they would observe *persistent recency*, where more recent items would be easier to recall even in the recall-by-category condition after participants had already recalled from one or two other categories. If they did observe persistent recency in the recall-by-category condition, this would mean that the recency effect persists even after participants have been distracted by recalling other information.\n",
